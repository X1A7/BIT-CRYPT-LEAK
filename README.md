# BIT-CRYPT-LEAK
exposing bit crypt

Bit crypt is a virus.
I attached the exe file to this repository, you can run a virustotal scan on it, it comes out as containing a trojan.
Scan by me: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/614b6b4d194dfc242b4f5d02713b333cbfdc7a42e83b022e73528fdf029c8688

The code in the python file is not exactly what he has although he essentially skidded that. 

After contacting multiple users banned from the BitCrypt discord server, they have all said the same thing: it's a scam.

Do what you please with the code given.
